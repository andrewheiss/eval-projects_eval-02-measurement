# Part 1: Measurement and abstraction for full-day kindergarten

There are no exact answers here, since you all will have identified different outcomes and figured out different ways of measuring them. I've included one here as a guide.

## Possible outcomes

The full-day kindergarten program has several intended outcomes: 

- Closing the gap between low achievers and high achievers
- Enhance reading skills
- Improve grades
- Increase commitment to school

## Outcome 2: Enhance reading skills

There are a lot of possible characteristics for this outcome, including:

- Sight word recognition
- Fluent reading with few pauses
- Comprehension
- Recall and remembrance
- Love of reading
- Ability to identify main arguments or characters or plot

For kindergartners, one way to capture reading skills is to look at (1) *word recognition*, since they should be moving beyond piecing together the individual phonemes in words like "the" and recognize the entire word unit quickly, (2) *fluency*, since they should be able to put words together with few gaps and pauses, and (3) *comprehension*, since they should be able to understand, remember, and summarize what they've read.

I have no idea if these are accurate attributes of reading skill—I'm not an expert in early childhood education. But we'll go with it for this. 

Here's how we can potentially measure these outcomes:

### Attribute 1: Sight word recognition

- *Measurable definition*: Student has the ability to recognize 200 (or some number) words by sight.
- *Ideal measurement*: Present student with 200 flashcards and measure how fast they read the words
- *Feasible measurement*: 200 flashcards in one sitting is intense, especially if measurements are repeated. It might be better to show students 10-15 random cards at a time to take a kind of random sample of words. Repeated measurements might cause burnout, so spread out tests over time.
- *Measurement of program effect*: Measure the average speed of 10 flashcards at the beginning of every month in both half-day and full-day kindergarten, then compare the difference in the average speed across the two groups over time. 

### Attribute 2: Fluency

- *Measurable definition*: Student has the ability to read a passage of text smoothly with minimal pauses, gaps, and prolonged vowels.
- *Ideal measurement*: Use some sort of peer-reviewed fluency scale or grading system to measure the number of pauses, accounting for length and difficulty of words (since it's easier to read "Sam has a cat" smoothly than more complex sentences). I have no idea if anything like that exists in the real world though.
- *Feasible measurement*: Have students read a passage to a teacher and ask the teacher to evaluate their fluency on a Likert scale like "Little fluency," "Somewhat fluent," "Fluent," and "Highly fluent." This won't be standard across schools, or even across teachers, but it's something.
- *Measurement of program effect*: Measure the average reading fluency at the beginning of every month in both half-day and full-day kindergarten, then compare the difference in the average fluency across the two groups over time. 

### Attribute 3: Comprehension

- *Measurable definition*: Student has the ability to understand a passage of text and summarize it through spoken words after reading it.
- *Ideal measurement*: Have students read a passage of text, wait some length of time, and then ask them to summarize what they've read. Use some sort of peer-reviewed scale that measures the complexity of their summary (i.e. if summarizing *Green Eggs and Ham*, a summary like "Sam I Am made his friend try new food" would score way lower than "Sam I Am convinced his friend to try new food by annoying him in lots of different places, and the friend ended up liking the food—it's a good example of peer pressure and openness to new experiences.") Again, I don't know if there's a standard way to measure this in real life.
- *Feasible measurement*: Have students read a passage out loud and then summarize the story. Ask the teacher to evaluate their comprehension on a scale of 1-5 or 1-10. Like fluency, this won't be standard across schools or teachers, but it's an attempt.
- *Measurement of program effect*: Measure the average reading comprehension at the beginning of every month in both half-day and full-day kindergarten, then compare the difference in the average comprehension across the two groups over time. 


# Part 2: Measurement and abstraction for your program

Hopefully you went through the same exercise above for your program.
